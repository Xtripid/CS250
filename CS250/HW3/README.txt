Homework 3:
I used Mealy-style machine for both my 2a and 2b. 
I was not sure whether or not we had to simplify our sum-of-products for each question but a TA said we did not have to. 
For question 3e see my diagram for what I labeled each edge.
For question 3c, In2 is the third bit, In1 is the second bit, and In0 is the first bit. So 1 is In2=0, In1=0, In0=1. 4 is In2=1, In1=0, In0=0.
For question 3d, a nickel is In1=0, In0=1, a dime is In1=1, In0=0, and a quarter is In1=1, In0=1.
For question 3e, In3 is the fourth bit, In2 is the third bit, In1 is the second bit, and In0 is the first bit. So 1 is In3 =0,In2=0, In1=0, In0=1. 8 is In3=1, In2=0, In1=0, In0=0. 
For each question I went through and tested them and made sure that they worked.
