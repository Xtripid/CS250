I did not set my register file or data memory to falling edge. They seem to work properly with rising edge so I did not change them. 
If you open up the circuit and see a lot of red wires/blue wires close the circuit and reopen it. For some reason sometimes when I open logisim it shows the wires as not working when they actually are.
I ran simple.s and a couple other instructions through it and it seemd to run fine.
